# Pathfinder
This is my first experiment with pygame, I made a pathfinding viewer that use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from start (blue square) to end (red square). It is also possible to draw some walls simply dragging on grid.

## How to use it:
- To run it, after you go in the same directory of the project, write in the console: `python3 Pathfinder.py`
- To make walls: drag with cursor on the grid
- To reset the grid: press **backspace**
- To execute the algorithm: press **enter**

## How it looks:
